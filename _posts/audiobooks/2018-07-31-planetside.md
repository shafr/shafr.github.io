Perfect example of Sci-fi detective  as it should be - without annoyances.

Great ammount of humor, not-a-superhero main character, cybernetics and technologies. 

Lots of detective work. Lots of action. Nice plot.

Last hour or 30 (or even 90) minutes was just a drag, the author was just preparing readers (or listeners) for the sequel. 

Still - highly recommending this book.

P.S. When I found out that second book was released, i've revisited this one. Still - great book, but I'm still sure that last segment was preparing us ... to nothing, since second book has almost nothing in common with first one.


Quotes:

>> Reacting means your enemy is dictating what you should do. And that is never good.

>> I've never been a particullary good luck for those around me. We won some fights, sure, but I've lost people. So many, that I could not name them without the list I've kept laminated on a card in my pocket. I needed to add five soldiers from my last trip to CAPA. They hadn't been  under my command but I still was responsible, at least in my mind.      

>> That didn't make it right for us to attack them. But there were more than one right. And I always picked the right  which helped our side.
