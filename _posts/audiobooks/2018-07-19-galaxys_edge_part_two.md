The second part is frankly kind of hit and miss. I'm not sure they knew where they were going - space combat, star-wars villains, hackers.
Looks like scenario for a tv-soap-opera, not like a solid book. 
Also i hate this `futurism` with spaceships with hyperdrives and engineers crawling with wrenches to fix them.
Or super missles which are targeted by laser. 
Or blast doors which are opened with tourches. 
Or energy shields which die from one shot. 
Or armor which does not protect from shots at all.

Technology-wise looks like a 20th century with ships and pirates but re-skinned for future.

Pros:
* Both sides were shown - no one is good or bad, everyone has their reasons
* Constant action
* Belivable characters

Cons: 
* Un-killable heroes
* Constant deus ex machinas which saves everyone at the last moment
* Unanswered questions 
* Useless and questionable technologies
* Explosions in space, lots of them
