That is how military detective should look like.

First books are fairly short - about 4 hours.

# Jack Reacher Rules
Skipped half of the book - just qoutes about how cool he is.

# Second son
This time Jack Reacher is like a young Sherlock Holmes.

# High Heat
Great story about fighting with crime lords and night at New York.

# The Enemy 
Dozens of `He said nothing` through the book (narrator enjoyed himself) and lot's of telephone calls. 
Great twist and lots of detective work.

# Night School
I did not like the narrator in this book and the plost twist with spy-chips, so skipped around 1H in.

# Killing floor
Now everyone in the book "shrugs" all the time, no more "he said nothing"'s here.
I've enjoyed this book - great plot twist, but it's kind of easy to guess from the beginning who's who. Also lots of violence.

# Die Trying


# Trip Wire
Great narration by Dick Hill - enjoyed his impersonation of different people.
Also great and (almost) unpredictable plot. As always some detective work, romance. Lee is following his book pattern.
