### Quotes:
> Everything was obvious in retrospect. They even had a name for it - "highnsight bias". It refered to dificulty of remembering how little you knew at that time, how uncertain  things were before they played out. Even wildly contengous events looked inevedeble in retrospect, but they weren't. And it's actually psychologically difficultly to imagine not knowing back then what you know now.
It was also easy to cherry pick the blown decisions after the fact.

> But good advice doesn't come in a box marked "good advice". And pointing out what facts he should've paid attention to at the time
was painting the bulls eye around where arrow happen to hit. But there was also no denial that Drakes arrows were going increasingly wild.
