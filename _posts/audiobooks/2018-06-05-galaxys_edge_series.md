## Part 0.5 

This one is kind of short story about robot who gave his life for humans. 
Hate this. The movies from 50th about cyborgs and dilemma if robots have souls.
But lots of action and details. 
Kind of `Hacksaw Ridge` but with killing robot instead of pacifist human.

Pros:

* Solid action
* Interesting storryteling

Cons:

* Very Short

## Part I (17h 21m)



## Part II (Books 3,4) (15h 24m)

The second part is frankly kind of hit and miss. I'm not sure they knew where they were going - space combat, star-wars villains, hackers.

Looks like scenario for a tv-soap-opera, not like a solid book. 

Also I hate this `futurism` with spaceships with hyperdrives and engineers crawling with wrenches to fix them.

Or super missles which are targeted by laser. 

Or blast doors which are opened with torches. 

Or energy shields which die from one shot. 

Or armor which does not protect from shots at all.

Technology-wise looks like a 20th century with ships and pirates but re-skinned for future.

Pros:

* Both sides were shown - no one is good or bad, everyone has their reasons
* Constant action
* Belivable characters

Cons: 

* Un-killable heroes
* Constant deus ex machinas which saves everyone at the last moment
* Unanswered questions 
* Useless and questionable technologies
* Explosions in space, lots of them

## Part Three (Books 5,6)

I'm really not sure about orgins of Galaxy's Edge, but it seems like they are trying to build universe more and more here.
There are quite a few parallel plots going on, lot's of stuff unexplained (like robot-race), savage wars, nether-ops, dark-ops, etc, that I feel more and more that I need a some wiki page along to understand what's going on.

Anyway, they are done with meaningless space fights, and Dart-Wader stuff from previous book, and are now to journey for some stuff. Again Han-Solo (Wraith), some Force-stuff (Prisma), some cyber-ghosts (Ravi).

Lot's of plot twists are started but not finished.

So lot's pf stealth, spec ops operations, space wars, etc as always.

I think the problem of this 9-part series of the books that you totally forget all the details after week of reading them.

>> There is a terrifiying point at war where you comprehend just how much of your survival depends on the luck.

>> And I realized that if he could get dusted like this than no amount of training can save you when the time came. The blast that killed Life was from a rifle that our armor  was fully capable of deflecting. If Life didn't loose his helmet, if I walked out first, if Life was few inches shorter, if any of those things, Life is still alive at the end of that day. But his luck ran out. It doesn't matter how good you are. You can be the perfect soldier, but if it's your time - you are dead, no arbitration hearing. 

>> To suggest otherwise, say in a whispered conversation in some darkened corridor on boarded destroyer with hope that the thrumming of sub-light engines kept one from being overheard - was career suicide. Because conversations, real conversations took two people. And in a cut-throat world of republic army, you didn't give an advantage over you, like the person on the other side of your conversation. Friendships were few and frail.

## The imperor 4/5
This is how ~~Dart Wader~~ Dark Goth got his name and became who he is. Of course bad guy was good guy at some point.

Pros:
* I really liked that they spend more time explaining the plot behind galaxy, savage wars, hyperspace drives.
* Awesome idea with the hyper-drives and colony ships.
* Also finally super powers are explained here.
* Finally we get to know about Rechs, Goth Soles, and other guys.

Cons:
* I really hate space combats sections in this books - they are really boring and exausing. 
* You really wish to stop reading book few times, so much I was exausted and tired from the deus-ex machinas moments.

Quotes:
* Combat is nothing but chances. Especially if you want to seize the momentum and maintain it. So that one was always ridiculous. 
* It was a picture of a family. Obviously they were getting a smartphone. A gadget. A toy to them in that lost age of abundance. They’d used that fantastic device to amuse themselves from moment to moment. With games. Or pictures. Or commercials of endlessly available goods and services. Or meaningless conversations that paled in importance to what was on the horizon and headed straight at them like a bullet.
* And yet he’d been luridly fascinated by Goths. As though they were the source of all his fears. He’d been driven to learn about them, to make them less… powerful. Less of a nightmare figure, always on the edge of his vision. Always waiting in the shadows. And instead… the very word Goth inspired a sense of dread darkness inside his mind despite all his efforts to haul it into the light.
* And they were wearing some type of advanced armor system like nothing Casper had ever seen before. Because, thought Casper as he watched himself watching all this once more from the future in the desert, because this is the version of armor that came before the Mark I legionnaire armor. The legendary armor Rechs would take for his own. The armor the Legion techs and scientists would try to reproduce, but would never really be able to.
* 	That quest was to leave physicality, to shed the real, and to become a superintelligent being who ruled the universe in a place beyond time, space, and reality. This was the true power. Once he obtained it, he would his bless his faithful servants with the gifts they deserved.
* And in this pause, a terrible history passed over them both once more. Both were suddenly unwilling tourists forced to remember some horrible vacation every time they came across the photos they’d so carefully hidden away. Hoping never to find them ever again. Because, of course, they’d both lived through that terrible vacation in hell. Lived through a long nightmare in which every moment was a never-ending hell in and of itself. Whenever some religious nut had tried to put the fear in Casper with their talk of eternal damnation, his reply had always been, “Don’t talk to me about hell. I’ve already been there.” Except often, later, in the quiet of his solitary life, he would admit that he was still afraid of going back to hell. Just a taste of it had been enough for him. And the taste itself hinted that yes, true hell might be real enough to consider.
* Because the Nazis knew there were no consequences for what they were doing. They weren’t religious, contrary to misinformation. They believed in nothing but blood and soil. They were the ultimate Darwinian evolutionists’ murder machine. They knew it was survival of the fittest and that there were no consequences for the ‘winners’ except winning the genetic survival lottery.
* His whole life had been that of a viewer watching a disaster unfolding. Yes, he’d tried to save what could be saved. But what had he really saved, in the final tally? The galaxy was on the edge of ruin. Some force from the Outer Dark beyond the galaxy was headed this way, if Reina’s last transmission was to be believed. All of it, all of everything they’d fought for and built, was spinning apart.

* He had no idea. And long ago he’d stopped thinking of himself as Casper Sullivan or any of the many other aliases he’d once used to try and save the Republic from itself. By any means save one.

> Though it surely seemed a non sequitur to the medic named Maydoon.

> That had been the agreement. Between Rechs, Reina, and Casper. They would never seek the power they’d seen inside the Quantum Palace. They, the only three survivors of the horrors on the ghost ship Moirai.

> The girl, the lone surviving medic from among the Martian light infantry who had set out to rescue Reina from inside the Moirai. She had survived, too. Take my hand, Corporal Maydoon! I’ll save you.

> They would watch the entire galaxy. Reina would watch the sciences; she would stop any development in a direction that might lead toward the paths the Savages had been wandering down. Rechs would watch the power struggles; he would see who might be putting themselves in front of the others a little too effortlessly. And then they would be smitten. Hence the Legion. And Casper… Casper would beat, cajole, and manipulate from behind the scenes. In a galaxy full of aliens, connected by the gossamer of hyperspace, he would form a government that might work together to keep an eye out for the Dark Wanderer. That might respond when the time came.

> But the Savages, who even then were beginning to come into communication with one another, were taking worlds of their own in which to grow their nightmare societies. The galaxy-wide conflict that would be known as the Savage Wars was coming. And that too was the reason for the Legion. And the Republic and its mighty navy.




## Iron Wolfes 3/5

Parallel story about fighting squad on the edge of the galaxy.

This series are now staring to be like `Romance novels` with simple or no major twists, just a small ammount of extra unviverse story, with forgettable characters, some ammount of romance, lots of shooting.

Just a books for passing by while waiting for major releases.
Rating: 3/5

## Order of the Centurion 4/5

Books that does not involve main characters here, trying to build up universe around here.

Like `The Imperor` book, this one tries to introduce young senator `Oren Kar` (how is his name spelled?) and Point general that was helping dark ops and other Legion forces in the end of book 6.

I feel like there is too much drama and "movie" like moments, deus-ex machinas, and twists just for the sake of being there. First books had less of those. Again using some weird formulas to build tension and explain plot.

Quotes: 

* The Legion was a strictly human force. That wasn’t because other species weren’t capable of forming elite fighting forces—anyone who’d ever faced a quad-wielding Tennar in a firefight, or tangled with a brutish Drusic in close quarters, would never again question their combat ability. It was because a humans-only approach was both efficient and effective. It allowed for standardization of equipment. It meant temperaments and motivations were reasonably aligned. It eliminated friction and made for more easily formed, stronger bonds, and greater camaraderie.

* In short… it worked. And when you were knee-deep in some backwater jungle, facing hostile forces, and the only thing between you and a quick death were your brothers-in-arms… that was all that mattered.

* He would die someday, and some complex and quiet part of him wanted to live so seriously and so dangerously that when that day came, he would feel like he had cheated death long enough. Like his dying was part of the bargain. Like it was only fair to the rest of the galaxy that a man who had lived so hard and so fast should finally catch up to the rest of the lost souls.

* He slapped his belly. Yeah, it was a belly, but there was a layer of rock-hard muscle below the surface. He’d be all right. He just had to tell the little bird that sat on his shoulder telling him to eat that extra slice of bread or drink that beer where it could stuff its feathers.

* Well, I guess you’d better let me go. I’ve got a lot of waiting and doing nothing planned for tonight.

* There was a time, when he was fresh out of the Legion Academy, that Subs wouldn’t have been caught dead joking around with a basic. The Legion was its own breed, the heartbreakers and life-takers, and everyone else wasn’t worth your time. But as the years passed, Subs came to realize that, regardless of which military branch they served, people were either cool or they sucked. No amount of Legion training could make a legionnaire who sucked fun to hang around with, even if he could KTF with the best of them.

* The speed of his movement was a testament to his agility—he was like some kind of suicidal mountain goat. 

* This kind of… damage… it was for the doros. Or for the unnamed souls who required all those coffins and body bags Wash had continually audited the resupply of back in his sweltering, hellish office hab.

> The Order of the Centurion is the highest award that can be bestowed upon an individual serving in, or with, the Legion. When such an individual displays exceptional valor in action against an enemy force, and uncommon loyalty and devotion to the Legion and its legionnaires, refusing to abandon post, mission, or brothers, even unto death, the Legion dutifully recognizes such courage with this award.
