# Part 0.5 
This one is kind of short story about robot who gave his life for humans. 
Hate this. The movies from 50th about cyborgs and dilemma if robots have souls.
But lots of action and details. 
Kind of `Hacksaw Ridge` but with killing robot instead of pacifist human.

Pros:
* Solid action
* Interesting storryteling

Cons:
* Very Short

# Part I (17h 21m)



# Part II (Books 3,4) (15h 24m)

The second part is frankly kind of hit and miss. I'm not sure they knew where they were going - space combat, star-wars villains, hackers.

Looks like scenario for a tv-soap-opera, not like a solid book. 

Also I hate this `futurism` with spaceships with hyperdrives and engineers crawling with wrenches to fix them.

Or super missles which are targeted by laser. 

Or blast doors which are opened with torches. 

Or energy shields which die from one shot. 

Or armor which does not protect from shots at all.

Technology-wise looks like a 20th century with ships and pirates but re-skinned for future.

Pros:
* Both sides were shown - no one is good or bad, everyone has their reasons
* Constant action
* Belivable characters

Cons: 
* Un-killable heroes
* Constant deus ex machinas which saves everyone at the last moment
* Unanswered questions 
* Useless and questionable technologies
* Explosions in space, lots of them

# Part Three (Books 5,6)

I'm really not sure about orgins of Galaxy's Edge, but it seems like they are trying to build universe more and more here.
There are quite a few parallel plots going on, lot's of stuff not explained (like robot-race), savage wars, nether-ops, dark-ops, etc, that I feel more and more that I need a some wiki page along to understand what's going on.

Anyway, they are done with meaningless space fights, and Dart-Wader stuff from previous book, and are now to journey for some stuff. Again Han-Solo (Wraith), some Force-stuff (Prisma), some cyber-ghosts (Ravi).

Lot's of plot twists are started but not finished.

So lot's pf stealth, spec ops operations, space wars, etc as always.

I think the problem of this 9-part series of the books that you totally forget all the details after week of reading them.

>> There is a terrifiying point at war where you comprehend just how much of your survival depends on the luck.

>> And I realized that if he could get dusted like this than no amount of training can save you when the time came. The blast that killed Life was from a rifle that our armor  was fully capable of deflecting. If Life didn't loose his helmet, if I walked out first, if Life was few inches shorter, if any of those things, Life is still alive at the end of that day. But his luck ran out. It doesn't matter how good you are. You can be the perfect soldier, but if it's your time - you are dead, no arbitration hearing. 

>> To suggest otherwise, say in a whispered conversation in some darkened corridor on boarded destroyer with hope that the thrumming of sub-light engines kept one from being overheard - was career suicide. Because conversations, real conversations took two people. And in a cut-throat world of republic army, you didn't give an advantage over you, like the person on the other side of your conversation. Friendships were few and frail.

# The imperor
Pros:
* I really liked that they spend more time explaining the plot behind galaxy, savage wars, hyperspace drives.
Awesome idea with the hyper-drives and colony ships.
Finally we get to know about Rex, Goth Soles, and other guys.

Cons:
I really hate space combats sections in this books - they are really boring and exausing. 
You really wish to stop reading book few times, so much I was exausted and tired from the deus-ex machinas moments.

Rating: 4/5 for story.

# Iron Wolfes
Parallel story about fighting squad on the edge of the galaxy.

This series are now staring to be like `Romance novels` with simple or no major twists, just a small ammount of extra unviverse story, with forgettable characters, some ammount of romance, lots of shooting.

Just a books for passing by while waiting for major releases.
Rating: 3/5
