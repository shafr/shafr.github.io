Like previous book (which wa boring for the last 30-90 minutes), this one is for the first 30-90.

I'm not sure why it takes so long to build up tension/plot, but it was boring as hell.

There was close to nothing to do on the planet this time.

Good action close to the end and some plot twists, lots of great quotes. But lots of places where I was bored...
