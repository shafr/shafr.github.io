# Black (Book 1)

Strangelly enough that all action-oriented and sci-fi, zombies-around books - R.C. Bray would take a female-oriented romance.

I wasn't able to follow what was going on there. I was too anoyed with secretary attitude. Ok to pass the time because of jokes and time passing. 

Special piece of art was conversation with barista about cofee ordering.


* Black kept his expression neutral and averted his eyes. His potential client’s trophy wife was coming on to him. Which could have been nothing, just a habit she had, the kind of thing bored, hot women did instinctively to any male within range. He knew the type, and while she was definitely exuding sex appeal like a Rainbird sprayed water, he got the feeling that it was equally unfocused, and he just happened to be the nearest target.

* Life was too damned short to subject himself to the kind of abuse that would be a constant part of that job, and he knew better than to accept a position that would make him miserable.

* Because I want to kill. I want to slake my thirst for blood and become the angel of death, snuffing out innocent life on a whim – the most vicious killer the Army has ever seen

*  He existed in a kind of celebrity purgatory where he was a known quantity, but despised for how he made his living. Paparazzi were like insects, swarming over the still-warm carcass of whatever object of fascination had attracted the public’s interest. And he was the king roach. He didn’t kid himself, and there was no self-loathing. Freddie was accepting of his station. But he’d gone from owner to towel boy overnight, and there wasn’t a day that went by that he didn’t curse Hunter and his bitch of a daughter for ruining his good thing.

* Fridays were big ones for trauma physicians all over town, as drug deals went south and passions ran hot ahead of Saturdays, which always set records for man’s inhumanity to his fellow man. Something about weekends brought out the killer instinct, the desire to rob that liquor store, jack that car, teach that bitch a lesson.)

* You can’t make the world perfect, Black. It’s always been a messy bowl of crap, and always will be. Take it from a guy who’s spent his life scooping it up after the fan sprays it everywhere. Take the wins when you get ’em, because you’re gonna have more losses than wins in the end. If you aren’t losing, you aren’t trying.
