I was long looking for a tool that looks like [Search everything][search-everything]

So the tool is called `mlocate`.

You would need to run the following to re-index files before doing search:
```bash
/etc/cron.daily/mlocate
#or 
updatedb
```

Search for files using
```locate
locate <file>
```

I found it helpful while using docker (without mounting temporary volumes).

Kudos to `Vaclav` for showing me this tool.
