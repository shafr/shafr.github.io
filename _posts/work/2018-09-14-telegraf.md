It has been almost year since I've run any kind of performance tests on Unix. Since recently i've been tasked on running one, I've decided to look up for new tools which does just that.
After some looking around i've stumbled upon [Telegraf][telegraf-link]. As they mention it's __The plugin-driven server agent for collecting & reporting metrics.__
So I would be using Telegraf to collect logs & send them to `graphite` to store and visualize. 


Let's go over the steps for installing and configuring the tool:

## 1 Telegraf Installation:
Fastest way is to use prepared packets (or if you have GO installed - install from source)
```bash
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/telegraf/nightlies/telegraf-nightly.i386.rpm &&\
rpm -i telegraf-nightly.i386.rpm
```
 
## 2 Grafana Installation:
Metrics can be stored in log file, or sent to a log server. I've ended up using Grafana log server.

I was using Docker version:

```bash
docker run -d \
--name graphite \
--restart=always \
-p 80:80 \
-p 2003-2004:2003-2004 \
-p 2023-2024:2023-2024 \
-p 8128:8125/udp \
-p 8126:8126 \
-v /opt/graphite/storage:/opt/graphite/storage \
graphiteapp/graphite-statsd
```

## 3 Generating config file for telegraf:
There are plenty of plugins that can be plugged into telegraf, but I was using only this guys:

| Plugin name   | Description                               | Configuration     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| cpu           | Info about cpu Usage                      | percpu=false      |
| filestat      | Collect file size on App server log files | list of files     |
| http_response | Get response time & code                  | url, method, body |
| mem           | memory Info                               | none              |
| net           | network bytes sent/received               | interface         |
| procstat      | Collects usage metrics per-process        | process id, name  |



So we need to generate config file with this plugins on the collector machine, that would be used later to run agent:

```bash
telegraf --input-filter cpu:mem:filestat:http_response:net:procstat -outputfilter graphite config > telegraf.conf
```

Open generated file with your favorite editor and edit parameters.

See table above for example of list of things to change. 

## 4 Run agents: 
```bash
telegraf --config telegraf.conf &
```

## 5 Visualize
Login to Graphite and start creating graphs. You can copy-paste path's from metrics page or use cli to get metrics from dashboard page.

### Some notes on visualization:
It is possible to export & import dashboards from/to JSON. So you can add just few of dashboards and then export them to file and add others manually. (And have a backup)
