Most of time at work I've been using Windows Os. Here are some tools that I'm constantly using: 

### Snippets [Website][snippets-site]
Great tool for storing snippets.
__Pros:__
* Supports tagging them, selecting categories 
* performing indexed search
* has great UI
__Cons:__
The stuff that I don't like is __Memory leak__ which happens when UI is opened for a while. 
It is fixed by killing app and starting again. 

### Mobaxterm [Website][mobaxterm-site]
Go-to tool for remote access to the machines. 

__Pros:__
* Remembers passwords for all connections.
* You can create shortcuts for different sessions. 
* Supports X-forwards by-default 
* Opens remote GUI for sftp/scp session by-default - great tool for files transfers
* Highlights text by default using different regexes or patterns
* Allows to increase/decrease font size
* Allows Multiple consoles execution, showing of multiple windows at the same time
* Allows to clean up scroll
* Allows to search text within console
* Has a great text editor tool, that allow remote text editing with code highlighting
* Highlights console tab header with blue if something had changed

__Cons:__
* Standard version supports only limited number of saved sessions. When you reach this limit - you cannot create shortcuts anymore.
* Sometimes it goes crazy especially if you have multiple input languages - it prints half of command in one language

### Lanuchy [Website][launchy-site]
This tool allows you to launch any application by pressing `ALT+SPACE` key combination.
Also it allows to calculate stuff in the same small window


### Process Explorer [Website][launchy-site]


### Vivaldi Browser [Website][vivaldi-site]
I've been using Firefox as my browser - mymain need is in so called `Tree style tab` - where all tabs are shown on the side of screen.

__PROS:__
* Has kind of tree style tab out of the box
* Uses Chrome engine - full support Chrome plugins
* Has nice settings page
* Does not tracks you 

__CONS:__
* Not always works with sites that have compatibility check with chrome or firefox browsers. 

### Frigate [Website][frigate-site]
My dual panel file manager. It was 10 years ago last time. But it's still working and I'm almost happy with it.

__PROS:__
* Dual panel manager
* Support for multiple tabs
* Great feature that I haven't seen anywhere - it shows recently created files with asterix. So just by glancing inside folder you can see what was added.
* Allows sorting and different kinds of viewing.
* Has a shortcut system - so you can label your favourite folders with key combination (CTRL+NUM)
* Has different color themes
* Can open different file types with built-in editors (F3). Works with big files (100GB)

__CONS:__
* Folder removal (sometimes) crashes if there are some NTFS handles. Need to open it in explorer and remove from here.
* Terrible performance when opening network drives that are not mounted 
* Crashes when opening .7z format
* Send-to menu option does not work with current versions of windows 
 
### Everything [Website][everything-site]
This is a great search tool for NTFS drives that does not need indexing in order to work. They say that they are just reading from NTFS table.

__PROS:__
* Instant search on the drive
* Support lots of regexes and patterns (path, type)
* allows to search within content as well

### Snap Timer [Website][snap-time-site]
Tiny utility that shows countdown on your taskbar.

### AIMP [Website][aimp-site]
My go-to player for music. Kind of like `winamp` but with more features and sound settings. 

__PROS:__
* Nice ui, skins support
* allows to put rating for songs, so you can remove them later 

### SumatraPDF [Website][sumatra-site]
Pdf Reader. Replaces Adobe or other PDF readers. 

__PROS:__
* Supports pdf and fb2
* Small and without fancy features which I would not need.
* Fast
* Main screen has thumbnails for most recent books opened

__CONS:__
* Somehow, it corrupts files which are sent for print. I'm not sure why, but at office i'm not able to make it print reliably, so i have to go back to Adobe Reader.
