## Problem

I wanted to help our CI team & was looking for a way how to mount `google bucket` to existing `k8s` cluster.

## Don't trust documentation:


There is a [official documentation mention](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#resource-backend) - especially code snipped: 

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-resource-backend
spec:
  defaultBackend:
    resource:
      apiGroup: k8s.example.com
      kind: StorageBucket
      name: static-assets
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /icons
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            backend:
              resource:
                apiGroup: k8s.example.com
                kind: StorageBucket
                name: icon-assets
```

This is the only mention of `StorageBucket` in the web. Someone wrote it, but haven't notified developers, tech writers and other people. You cannot find that in API.

## Solution for a problem:

So trying different annotations (and thanks for stackoverflow for initial vector), going through different options I had figured out:

Service Part (only one should exist per bucket):
```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: google-storage-buckets
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: storage.googleapis.com
  ports:
  - name: https
    port: 443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 443
```

Ingress Part:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: css-resources
  namespace: {{ .CLUSTER }}
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/secure-backends: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-vhost: "storage.googleapis.com"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: <google-cloud-bucket>/<path-to-resource-folder>/$2
spec:
   ingressClassName: nginx
   tls:
    - hosts:
      - <your virtual host you are routing from>
   rules:
   - host: - <your virtual host you are routing from>
     http:
      paths:
      - path: <path in your virtual host>
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: google-storage-buckets
            port: 
              number: 443
```

## Bonus - for testing:
I found it hard to test at first, so adding extra annotation allowed me to track if bucket is used through cookie:

```yaml
...
metadata:
  ...
  annotations:
    ...
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |
      more_set_headers "<cookie name>:<cookie value>";
      more_set_headers "gcp-bucket-test-path: /my-bucket";
```
