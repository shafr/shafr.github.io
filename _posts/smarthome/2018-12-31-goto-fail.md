### DSC wifi adapter:
See images from post [dsc-programming][_posts/smarthome/2019-02-11-dsc-1864-programming.markdown].

### Witty cloud board:
See article on [witty cloud][_posts/smarthome/2019-10-15-creating-pcb-witty-cloud.md], but i'm still not sure what wen't wrong there. 

It took me a while to get over that issue and order new pcb with better design.

### Fan replacement for Raspberry Pi
Never apply force when working with small electronics. Ideally you should heat up with heating fan and it would come loose. 
Othewise you would see internals of your SOC.

### Din case for Raspberry pi
See previous lesson. Never apply force before visualy observing. SD card slot broke from it's mount and device became unusable...

### Magichome LED strip controller
Don't use cheap soldering irons. Or you would end up with dead IC's.

### Sonoff Lightbulb adapter
Terrible decision to solder wires there where I accidentally removed some capacitor so devices stop working. Fixed by David solderign skills.

### Buck-down modle
Don't trust 3D printed cases from other people. 

One should add some margin for error, at least few millimeters, so device made in chinese cellars would fit case made by diy 3d printer.

### Kitchen over re-wiring
That's not my fault rather designers of it (or 10 years of constant usage):
