So we decided to do a custom clearance by ourselves for packages that arrived from DHL.
It's not so obvious as it may seem to be.

Here are some steps for that:

* Get message from DHL. Choose - I want to do a clearance myself. You have 10 days for that or they would charge you for storage of the goods.
* Get PDF's from them and print them.
* If possible - buy JSD forms (you cannot print them or get anywhere online) and fill them. Check out CEVT address below or you can also buy JSD forms inside PSTCLC company inside customs building.
* Fill out the forms before going there
* Go to address of Border Office.
* Give officers set of documents and wait for them to process the data around ~30 min
* Go to the 2nd floor and pay tax.
* Take the papers with stamps that they had provided and go to DHL and pick up your goods / send them over e-mail and wait for the goods to arrive.

### Checklist of required documents / things to come there with + fields where to put them:
* Passport or Obcanka
* EORI - special code which you would use for all shipments. Is generated on [customs website][EORI]
* DHL papers that you've printed
* Printed bank account statement with spend sum
* Printed page from shop showing price and list of goods if not provided by shop
* Prepared [TARIC][TARIC] code for the goods
* Written down somewhere Exchange rate for the purchase month from [here][EXCHANGE]

# Check list:
* Check field 31. IF you have different type of goods that will need to fill out separate document `ID 24312` for each type of goods.
* If you pay more then 22 EUR you will pay 15-22% tax
* If you pay more than 150 EUR you will pay 3-11% tax 
* Field 44 is very confusing.
