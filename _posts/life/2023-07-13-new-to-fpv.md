So you are new to FPV, you are going to resources like "reddit" and asking where to start. Here's a list for you.

1. Go to google and search for drone flight map. Like this - https://dronview.rlp.cz . See if there are places around you where you can fly. (If you live in densly populated areas with no parks or gardens in a flat, it'll be hard to go out and fly)
1. You'll have to figure out a lot of new stuff, check this before you would buy your drone / controller. If you are overwhelmed with info and think that you don't have time for all this - buy DJI.

   * [controller firmware](http://edgetx.org/index)
   * [transmitter / receiver firmware](https://www.expresslrs.org)
   * [ESC firmware](https://github.com/mathiasvr/bluejay)
1. Watch:
   *  [Videos from Joshua Bardwell](https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaBardwell), fpv24 and others.
   *  [read blog from Oscar Liang](oscarliang.com)
   *  [Videos from Nick Burns](https://www.youtube.com/@NickBurnsFPV)
   *  [Videos from Captain Drone](https://www.youtube.com/@CAPTAINDRONE798)

1. Buy yourself a FPV remote. Something like "Radiomaster Zorro", "Jumper t-pro", and others with "EdgeTx" inside.
1. Install any FPV emulator, learn to fly **acro** mode.
1. Get a [free A1/A3 certificate](https://learningzone.eurocontrol.int/ilp/pages/description.jsf?menuId=1106#/users/@self/catalogues/8264768/courses/15839789/description). You'll learn a lot of theoretical stuff that you would not think otherwise.
1. See all Reddit posts with finger and face scratches. Configure your FPV remote to arm with 2 buttons, **cannot skip this step**. [There's a playlist for you](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtAjsQHT4EDGeTugOd6LqD8D8qYvno23i). It would arm accidentally. Better be safe.
1. Buy or assemble drone. I personally recommend first drone to be pre-assembled - you'll have to learn a lot of new things at first, so it would be better to distribute that learning curve. I bought "DarwinFPV Baby Ape" and it's fun to fly.
