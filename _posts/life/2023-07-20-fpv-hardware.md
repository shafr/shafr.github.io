This is second commonly asked question. What solder to choose, what charger, etc. I have collected a list of things available from aliexpress or any other store.

1. $45 __Soldering iron__: [KSGER T12 OLED Soldering Iron Station][ksger-t12]. I've tried quite a few and this one is the best in terms of price. It's a clone of Hakko soldering station and is using it's tips. (If you have sligthly more money - go ahead and buy original). It's tiny in size. This specific model requires external power supply.  I'm using either:
   * Dell Laptop 19V power supply + [barrel 5.5x2.1mm adapter][5.5x2.1mm ali]. Works the best for the people who has one of those around.
   * USB type C power supply + [PD 100W Laptop Power Charger Supply Adapter 5.5x2.1mm trigger][trigger ali].
2. $20 __Power supply__:   Do not buy those bullshit smoke stoppers. Buy this [small power supply][power supply ali] where you can:
   * regulate voltage (to set something like 5v, ~2s, ~4s equivalent what you want). 
   * Set up a current cap. So if there is short-circuit it would stop power delivery. 
   * Shows graphs on display. You'll need a bit of soldering to make wires for your use case (like input from type c )
