So suddenly during my game of Half-Life ALYX (which is OK and stunning looking, but not great) joystick on my right controller got stuck in right position and was not returning back by itself. It wasn't the best experience of this game, but i managed to finish level and decided to look inside.

Aparently only 2 people in the world own WMR controllers and had to dissasemble it. 

[English Version][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh5C3IlaQ0g]
[Russian Version][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj3eiP_QI8A]

Note how everyone is telling - gently pull joystick untill top part comes out. 

`DON'T DO IT`. 

Not for new version of WMR controllers.

# Here is how you dissasemble your WMR controller

* You have to unscrew bottom 4 screws from a battery compartment.
* You use something very thin (like a screwdriver, plastic tool for phone dissasembly or scalpel if you are desperate) to carefully remove the cap around joystick (it is mounted in few places with plastic mounts).
* You unscrew 5 more screws from the front
* Finally you carefully un-clip both sides of controller.

See photos below, maybe they would help

# Replacement parts
If you would need new thumbpad-joysticky thing - i found exact one on Aliexpress:

[2PCS For XBox One Original 3D Analog Joystick Module Thumbstick Replacement For PS4 PS 4 Controller][https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32859369585.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.3a444c4d1Hn3Lz]


Actually they all look the same in terms of contacts, so replacement should not be hard to find.
