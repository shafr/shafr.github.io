I wanted to assemble list of useful resources for drone owners in Czech Republic:
* [Infographics for drone owners](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/light/topics/operators-guidance-drone-pilots)
* [Chatbot that answers question what category your drone is in and what you need to know](https://www.dronald.cz)
* [Map with allowed places to fly in Czech Republic](https://dronview.rlp.cz)
* [Drone pilot / Drone owner registration](https://dron.caa.cz)
* [Free A1/A3 Course with Certification](https://learningzone.eurocontrol.int/ilp/pages/description.jsf?menuId=1106#/users/@self/catalogues/8264768/courses/15839789/description)


TLDR:
* You cannot legally fly sub-250 FPV drone **without permission** in center of Prague. 
* However much tempting you should never fly near some active emergency services. ( Idea is that you'll distract ongoing activity, you can crash heli and go to jail.)
* You'll need to get a A1(sub-250), A3(sub-25KG, cannot fly near buildings, crowds of people) drone license.
* I really recommend going through that free course - there was a lot of stuff that I haven't though about, like cloud shapes, interference from power lines and structures, planning for winds.
