So we decided to do a custom clearence by ourselves for packages that arrived from DHL.
It's not so obvious as it may seem to be.

Here are some steps for that:


* [D] Get message from DHL. Choose - I want to do a clearence myself. You have 10 days for that.
* [D] Get PDF's from them and address with originals.
* [D] Go to DHL Address mentioned there and pick up documents.
* [P] Go to address of Shop and buy few `JSD` forms
* [S] On theier website - generate special code which you would use for all shimpments.
* [S] Go to address of Border 
... TBD







All of this locations are about 10 minutes from each other (by car) and are outside of Prague.
