I really like the passion that Egyptian goverment/management for creating rules / regulations & the way that they are implemented.

Below are few examples that I really liked:

# Swimming pool switch
Not sure what it does (drains water, stops pumps ?), if it works, but few switches all over are very handy.

# Safe
Almost all hotels have safe screwed up to a shelf on which it is located, with 2 weak screws. 

So it would be more convenient to carry it with a shelf.

# Toxic waste

That's very encouraging - waste that is marked as toxic where you throw paper towels or cups.

# WiFi Password

There's a free hotspot where you log in and need to enter username & password. It's very hard to guess. Also it uses some very complicated javascript to hash it & send to server.

**P.S.** The one thing that they did right was responses for wrong password on internet connection - it always responds with HTTP200, no matter if correct / incorrect password.
