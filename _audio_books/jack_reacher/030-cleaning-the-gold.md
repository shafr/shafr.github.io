A short story where they were able to put some action and plot twist. Narration wasn't the best, but it's ok for it's 2 hours.

# Quotes: 

> ... he made a show of ducking under the low ceiling, mostly because Baldani had a foot of clearance. The major looked up at Will with a specific kind of fury in his eyes. Small Man’s Hysteria, Will’s girlfriend called it, and she should know because she was taller than Baldani, too.

> The kid turned out to be thirty, and Reacher liked him a lot. A good age. Reacher remembered it well. The endless energy. The passion. Plus the guy was smart. And polite, but in a civilized way, not obsequious.

> The guy didn’t feel like a soldier. Certain words. He was totally willing to take instruction, but not unthinking reflex automatic. Not like the Army. He was a little closed up. He had a personal secret. Not possible, in the big green machine. It would have been beaten out of him long ago.

> The courts had extrapolated this contents of the mind reasoning to everything from opening your phone with your fingerprint to using your biometrics to unlock your computer. As far as self-incrimination went, there was nothing more self than your physical person. Your thoughts, like remembering a combination or a phone passcode, belonged solely to you. Your fingerprints, your eyes, your face, the shape of your ears, your walking gait, and especially your DNA—these were yours alone, and the courts were loath to turn them against you without a damn good cause.

> A brig is on a ship. We’d be confined to the stockade, Captain Wolfe
