Jack reacher himself fights 2 mobs - Ukrainian and Albanian. This one feels more like Rambo, not classic Jack Reacher. But still a solid book and nice thing to listen.

# Quotes: 

> "Suddenly I realize I should be happy with the status quo. Where would I find enough honest men to run your operations? Apparently I can’t even find enough to run my own."

> The kindness of strangers, Reacher said. Makes the world go round. Some guy wrote a play about it.

> Ten years later, at forty, she was still doing well, but she felt her trajectory had slowed. Her acceleration had been blunted. She could see her ceiling above her. She would sit at her desk and think, is this it?

> At first it went pretty well. ... and two or three times in the first year it looked like they might make it to the top of the hill. But they didn’t. Not quite. The second year was the same. Still glossy and glamorous and cutting edge and the next big thing, but nothing actually happened. The third year was worse. Investors got nervous. The cash spigot was turned way down. But they hung in, lean and mean. They rented two floors of their building. No more pizza or candy. The massage tables were folded up and put away. They worked harder than ever, side by side in cramped quarters, still determined, still confident.

> He sensed the physical release in her. Some kind of bone-deep animal satisfaction. But something else also. Something more. She felt safe. She felt safe, and warm, and protected. She was luxuriating in it. She was celebrating the fact she was feeling it.

> "Are you married?" - "No, The decision is only fifty per cent mine, I guess that would explain it".

> Did they teach you kicking down doors in the Corps? No, they gave us bazookas ...  stamp your foot flat through the door. ... Nearest the keyhole. That’s where the tongue of the lock is. That’s where the most amount of wood has been chiselled out of the frame. Hence where it’s weakest. That’s what you’re looking for. It’s always the frame that breaks. Never the door.

> Not good. What the military academies would call a tactical challenge. A head-on assault against a numerically superior opponent in a tightly constrained battle space. Added to which, the guys from the street corners would fold into the action from the rear. Bad guys in front, bad guys behind, no body armour, no grenades, no automatic weapons, no shotguns, no flamethrower.

> It’s something they teach you in the army. The only thing under your direct control is how hard you work. In other words, if you really, really buckle down today, and you get the intelligence, the planning, and the execution each a hundred per cent exactly correct, then you are bound to prevail. ... What they really mean is, if you fail today, it’s completely your own fault.
