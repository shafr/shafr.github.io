Great narration by Dick Hill - enjoyed his impersonation of different people.
Also great and (almost) unpredictable plot. As always some detective work, romance. Lee is following his book pattern. 
Cleaning blame for a a guy who died during Vietnamese wars and getting rid of credit crime lord in a nutshell.

# Quotes:

> He had gone from being a big fish in a small pond to being nobody. From being a senior and valued member of a highly structured community to being just one of 270 million anonymous civilians. From being necessary and wanted to being one person too many. From being where someone told him to be every minute of every day to being confronted with three million square miles and maybe forty more years and no map and no schedule.

> People live, and then they die, and as long as they do both things properly, there's nothing much to regret.

> ... a dozen of his friends from the military police would come running. Two dozen. A hundred. All of them willing and anxious to repay his many kindnesses and favours which stretched right back through their whole careers.

> Married officers with a family often bought a place, generally near their first service base or near some other location they imagined was going to be central to their lives, like West Point. They bought the place and usually left it empty while they lived overseas. The point was to have an anchor, somewhere identifiable they knew they would come back to when it was all over.

> She paused and looked directly at Reacher. For a second he thought she had spotted some symptom he was displaying. Then he realized she was waiting for an introduction.

> Like people she knew, lawyers or bankers, who had really wanted to be dancers or ballplayers. A dream from the past, unconnected with reality, but absolutely defining the identity of the person involved. A divorced thirty-year-old woman, who had wanted to be with Jack Reacher all along.

> Body guarding was about defense. Start mixing offense in with it, and neither thing gets done properly.

> She was not an unfit woman, but she always said I'm built for comfort, not for speed. 

> He guessed these were middle-ranking people. A long way from the bottom, but nowhere near the top. In Army terms, these were the majors and the colonels. They were the civilian equivalents of himself

> The whole point of drifting was happy passive acceptance of no alternatives. Having alternatives ruined it.

>  He was a meticulous man, attentive to tiny detail as much in his ethics as in his professional specialty.
