The start is great, the constant chasing and traveling. Dick hill with a great narration of Italian people. 

Great Personalities (Evil guy, Priest, main character, Buddy-buddy guy).

I was expecting more from a plot twist.

Last 2 hours books gets repetitive - trying to recall what happened before and does not produce anything exciting anymore.

This book had aged very much. All the digital highways, floppy drives, windows and macs, phone booth's with plastic cards <spoiler>nanotechnologies, video editing</spoiler>, and other stuff that was popular in 2000th.
