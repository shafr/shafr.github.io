### Pros:

* Great concept - final space flight, cosmonauts and stuff
* Some historical insights and some techincal details that are not tiring.
* Space guys 

### Cons:

* The main plot twist is kind of weak, unpredictable but really dumb.
* Ending is also weak, at the moment <spoiler> when killer was found </spoiler> - the main person takes his time to deliver information to others, instead of calling it in instantly.
* Also I hate when some thing that you had already figured out is being repeted and mashed for many times.
