It's actually 3 books, but I didn't want to create separate series, since they are very similar.

This is a great book, but it had some pacing issues - few times I had feeling that book should stop now, but it still continued to advance. 
At the moment when you think everything is ok now - they still have some trouble.


First one have enough action, traveling, 

Right around the middle of second book author realizes that he has very few things to tell about so he enters reminding streak where he repeats over and over about the mission and what will happen if they will not succeed. So around 50% is warnings instead of something new.

Also second book is much darker in tone - lots of death and killings, while first one was a pleasant journey.

### P3

It's all about anticipation of aliens arrival. 50% of book is discussion `what if`. What would they do, how should we meet them, what can they do for us. It's very tiresome to listen. There is even less things going on. It tries to be philosophical.
There is some action, but it's there for sake of putting something into book.

What I loved was president and political stuff.
