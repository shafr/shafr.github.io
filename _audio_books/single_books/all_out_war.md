If I would need to explain this book in one sentence it is `Power fantasy comes to life`. 
Probably this book was inspired by 90th movies.

Superhero fights super-villains with big guns. Everything is tuned out to 500%. 
Everyone is super-tough uber killer with lighting reflexes.
He is only working with president of free world, fighting nuclear bomb threats from most evil countries.
Nothing he does is on a small scale. No one he deals is a small person.

I'm getting tiered fast with one liners after or before someone is killed or have-fives. 
It romanizes killing and impulsive actions.
World is colored on white/black. We don't see motivations behind any actions, they do stuff only because they are evil.

I was not able to finish the book - to annoyed.
