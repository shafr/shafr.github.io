Again zombies, again fighting them. Aliens, zombie hordes, etc...

## A Time to Die

Pros: 
* Parallel storytelling - few plots that are connected in the end.
* Interesting idea and plot advancing - more than your typical zombie audiobook
* Some interesting workarounds from military personel, thinking outside of the box

Cons: 
* I hate ultimate survival of heroes - like pilot surviving 3 airplane crashes everything else seems ok.
* Few deus ex machinas - when help arives at the exact point when needed, 
* As always someone who is crying out "We are going to die" over and over (Wade)
* As always there should be some love plot going on as well

## A Time to Run
