# Quotes: 

> After thirty years as a collector, it was my experience that most self-appointed leaders never attained that kind of clout. I never cared to ask how much Pervenio was paying these people to spend their lives in the mines, but what Yev was demanding must’ve been quite appealing if his followers stood so adamantly against the most powerful corporation in Sol.

> If life existed on whatever planet it wound up on, I couldn’t imagine what those creatures might think when that metallic mammoth pierced the sky. And even if the ship never actually reached another star, there was no denying it was one hell of a funereal send-off.

>  ... Church of the Three Messiahs—which took the texts of what I’m told used to be Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, and blended them into what became known as the Final Testament. Maybe it all used to make sense, but the Meteorite jumbled everything from nations, to religions, to people’s sense of things.
