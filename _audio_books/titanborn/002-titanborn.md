Well after hearing 3 of the books I cannot say that I remember much from each of them aside that I enjoyed them.

Pros: 
* Great connectivity if one can say that between books, plots are connected from book to book, need to pay attention not to miss anything
* Interesting plot and story (Space traveling, Collectors profession)
* Of course evil corporations and wars between them


Cons:
* Third book first half is boring politics that I hate
* 

Not much quotes here.
