This book is much more global and Epic then previous ones. Here Jerry just takes a tiny role, and you feel that he's actions does not affect anything unlike book 2.

The begining of the book reminded me something that i've read before, but after that it had changed drasticly. The scale and people that are taking part is huge.

This is first book that Dick Hill is narrating Indian people, did a good job but not great. He has much more experience with arabic or asian people.

The end of the book was so sudden and unexpected, almost thrown out there. After such big built-up i was expecting something else.
