## Spec Ops

* In the military, if you weren't early, you were late

* it is better to remain silent and be thought an idiot, than to speak and remove all doubt

* Start small, and work your way up

* How come heart attacks never happen when you need one? Anyway, our team of scientists were more than happy to attempt explaining quantum topology to me, which should have been my first warning sign.
