Where Jack Reacher was just kicking everyone and silently disposing bodies this book raises political topic on the actions - how people would react on this event. Killer should be found or city will burn in flames. Someone should be blamed or people would be unrestfull. You must follow protocols. And then get sued by guilty people because they can.

Written shortly (or not much) after events from 1992 riots in San Francisco this book is deeply influecned by them.


But the part of the book that is technology-related have aged so much:
* cell phone in cars
* Pagers
* Information superhighway
* Times when people have to explain how web pages and internet servers work
