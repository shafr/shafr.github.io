When 

`Jack reacher` is about toughness and kicking ass and disappearing, 

`Black` is about comedy and having fun

`Harry Bosch` series is about depression, responsibility and decay.


When you listen for Bosch book series one by one without big delay you start to notice pattern:

* always under pressure (court, building demolition, journalists)
* there is always woman (often victim's wife)
* when you think that finally case was solved - there is one more thing. Very Often it is very unexpected.
