If I would need to summarize this book with one sentence I would probably say - `Submarines in space`. 
This book listens like "Crash Drive", except that starting from a second part of a book it's a constant catastrophe and trying to survive.

Great build-up to a series of books, great concept. Let's see where it would lead to.
