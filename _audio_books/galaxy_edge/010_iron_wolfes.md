Parallel story about fighting squad on the edge of the galaxy.

This series are now staring to be like `Romance novels` with simple or no major twists, just a small ammount of extra unviverse story, with forgettable characters, some ammount of romance, lots of shooting.

Just a books for passing by while waiting for major releases.
Rating: 3/5
