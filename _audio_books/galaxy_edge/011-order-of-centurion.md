Books that does not involve main characters here, trying to build up universe around here.

Like `The Imperor` book, this one tries to introduce young senator `Orrin Kaar` and Point general that was helping dark ops and other Legion forces in the end of book 6.

I feel like there is too much drama and "movie" like moments, deus-ex machinas, and twists just for the sake of being there. First books had less of those. Again using some weird formulas to build tension and explain plot.

Quotes: 

* The Legion was a strictly human force. That wasn’t because other species weren’t capable of forming elite fighting forces—anyone who’d ever faced a quad-wielding Tennar in a firefight, or tangled with a brutish Drusic in close quarters, would never again question their combat ability. It was because a humans-only approach was both efficient and effective. It allowed for standardization of equipment. It meant temperaments and motivations were reasonably aligned. It eliminated friction and made for more easily formed, stronger bonds, and greater camaraderie.

* In short… it worked. And when you were knee-deep in some backwater jungle, facing hostile forces, and the only thing between you and a quick death were your brothers-in-arms… that was all that mattered.

* He would die someday, and some complex and quiet part of him wanted to live so seriously and so dangerously that when that day came, he would feel like he had cheated death long enough. Like his dying was part of the bargain. Like it was only fair to the rest of the galaxy that a man who had lived so hard and so fast should finally catch up to the rest of the lost souls.

* He slapped his belly. Yeah, it was a belly, but there was a layer of rock-hard muscle below the surface. He’d be all right. He just had to tell the little bird that sat on his shoulder telling him to eat that extra slice of bread or drink that beer where it could stuff its feathers.

* Well, I guess you’d better let me go. I’ve got a lot of waiting and doing nothing planned for tonight.

* There was a time, when he was fresh out of the Legion Academy, that Subs wouldn’t have been caught dead joking around with a basic. The Legion was its own breed, the heartbreakers and life-takers, and everyone else wasn’t worth your time. But as the years passed, Subs came to realize that, regardless of which military branch they served, people were either cool or they sucked. No amount of Legion training could make a legionnaire who sucked fun to hang around with, even if he could KTF with the best of them.

* The speed of his movement was a testament to his agility—he was like some kind of suicidal mountain goat. 

* This kind of… damage… it was for the doros. Or for the unnamed souls who required all those coffins and body bags Wash had continually audited the resupply of back in his sweltering, hellish office hab.

> The Order of the Centurion is the highest award that can be bestowed upon an individual serving in, or with, the Legion. When such an individual displays exceptional valor in action against an enemy force, and uncommon loyalty and devotion to the Legion and its legionnaires, refusing to abandon post, mission, or brothers, even unto death, the Legion dutifully recognizes such courage with this award.
