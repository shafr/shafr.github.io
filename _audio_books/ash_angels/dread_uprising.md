This book Really deep concept and lore Of Ash Angels and Dreads. Plot is also ok, easy to follow, logical, lots of humor.

Last 2.5 hours turns this book into drama, after action, thriller, adventure and fun it becomes one of <spoiler> Mega-evil person is trying to destroy world, almost kills our hero and then dies </spoiler>. I hate lazy Ex-machina at the end.
