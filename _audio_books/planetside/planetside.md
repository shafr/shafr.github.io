Perfect example of Sci-fi detective  as it should be - without annoyances.

Great amount of humor, not-a-superhero main character, cybernetics and technologies. 

Lots of detective work. Lots of action. Nice plot.

Last hour or 30 (or even 90) minutes was just a drag, the author was just preparing readers (or listeners) for the sequel. 

Still - highly recommending this book.

P.S. When I found out that second book was released, i've revisited this one. Still - great book, but I'm still sure that last segment was preparing us ... to nothing, since second book has almost nothing in common with first one.


# Quotes: 

> Reacting means your enemy is dictating what you should do. And that is never good.

> I've never been a particularly good luck for those around me. We won some fights, sure, but I've lost people. So many, that I could not name them without the list I've kept laminated on a card in my pocket. I needed to add five soldiers from my last trip to CAPA. They hadn't been  under my command but I still was responsible, at least in my mind.      

> That didn't make it right for us to attack them. But there were more than one right. And I always picked the right  which helped our side. 

>  I fought the urge to stand. These two might have the break I needed. Computer types wouldn’t feel political pressure. They were naturally immune. Or oblivious. I gave what they said a lot of credence.

> The secret to drinking yourself to sleep is to drink just the right amount. You need to have enough to get you to sleep, but not so much that you pass out and then wake up four hours later, unable to get back to sleep. It was an art ... and usually I was a master.

> You got unlucky, Hardy. It happens. If it happens too many times, people will stop wanting to ride with you. 

> hen you go home ... even before you go home, but to a lesser extent ... people are going to want to talk to you about your experience. All the time. It’s going to happen so much that you’re going to get sick of it, and it’s going to frustrate you, because it’s all anybody is going to want to talk about. It’s not their fault. They’ve read about it, seen it in the holos, read it on the news feeds, but obviously they’ve never actually experienced it. It’s new and different to them, and you’re right there.

> The enemy had other ideas. They always do.

> She was going to make it in our business, assuming she lived through this fight. That’s what the good ones did. If they panicked, they got over it fast.

> And it would go wrong. No matter what happened, it was the kind of decision that news people and politicians and even military leaders would second-guess. If only they’d considered this, if only they’d thought about these other factors. They’d armchair-general the decision to death, after they had more information than we’d ever see. They’d find something wrong with the decision, no matter what decision I made. It’s what they always did.

> Stirling met us in the hall, doing some sort of funky run where he tried to make it look like he was walking.
