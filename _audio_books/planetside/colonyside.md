Well this book learned a lot from previous titles - no bullshit from the start, no spending hours on introductions and plot building.

Fast pace, again great humor, and action.

Book tells us how Butler tries to wind up plot by interacting with 3 sides: corporation / military / environmental guys .

Also dozen of noticeable political correctness in a book, he equally distributes colors and races between soldiers.

Just one mega ex-machina close to the end, but I can forgive author, it was hard to figure out other ending.
