### Quotes:

Unforgiving game. I purchased & installed it on Steam Deck right before my vacation & it was a stress experience. The worst part is rune loss, where you have to come back to pick it up. 

Mods do really help fixing things, but often I caught myself on the though "it would be great to have CheatEngine" to help with the grinding part.

PC experience is much better, but it's impossible to play without controller.

Also I haven't experimented much with different weapons & armor. If it works then it works in most cases.

Really like the samurai class.

It's great for Souls fans, but lot of things you have to figure out yourself or just know - the quests followup, crafting, different magic, etc...
