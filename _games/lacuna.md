### Quotes:

I wouldn't say that it's much of point-and-click game, more like narrative driven story & try to remember the stuff from before.

There is a lot of quality of life things:
* Everything happens within one screen
* All the dialogs, news & stuff is saved into the memory so you can always come back

What was unclear for me is when it would unfold & how long it would last. 
There is a great buildup which leads to nothing much.
There is kind of branching based on your choices, but I had no motivation to go through all branches.

Music is fine. Graphics is fine. It's hard to get lost in the game since it holds your hand a lot.
