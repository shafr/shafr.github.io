# Skyscraper 1/5

I hate this action for action type of movies from 90th. And the latest desire to please Asian watchers - half of the movie is spoken in Asian. 

 Where there is no scenario plot, hero is unkillable and cannot be injured.

 Everything is generic in this movies - evil balkanian group, astmatic chiledren and when you need to explain them your actions during emergency, wife that does not communitcates with the husband except for one liners, and the building.

 The tech side got me crazy - they clearly learned from `Mission Impossible` underwater vault, where data was stored - obviosly security console should be located in the most hard-to-get place. Good luck with maintenance.

 And also good luck with fire department certification - all security depends on remote cite / tablet.

 Why won't just kindap the guy instead of putting whole building on fire? 

 # Gringo 4/5
 A good one - interesting plot, good cast, untrivial ending. Solid personas.
