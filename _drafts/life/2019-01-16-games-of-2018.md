I've noticed that 


# Subnautica
One of the first games of the year that I've experienced - great game for Exploration & Crafting. Great amount of mods available that kill routine (inventory management, number of slots, reciepes creating, etc).

# Graveyard keeper
Great game in the beginning untill you realize that it's grinding for grinding. Lot's of crafting tables that have only one goal - to craft materials to proceed with other crafting table. Repeat.

# State of decay 2 
Great game for zombie genre lovers. Not sure why everyone is complaining so much about it 



# Assasins Creed Egypt

# Slime Rancher

# Fornite

# Space Rangers HD
Back to this game again. I just found out that there is million of mods available, so gameplay was much more interesting. Space fights + hyperspace. 

# Dungeon 3

# Fallout 4
Back to original game with heavy modding. Playing like a murderer / cleptomaniac - wiping map clean of anything.  

# Monument Valley
Spend winter holidays building farm with my wife. Lot's of gridning which can be fixed with mods.

# What remains of Edith Finch
Great 2H game with interesting storytelling.

# Prey: MoonCrash
One of a few games with FPS + Rougelike genre.
