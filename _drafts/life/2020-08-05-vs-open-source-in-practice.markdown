Recently I've installed ubuntu on my mobile phone (Xiaomi 4X). It was a great experience, but since it was my main phone, I had to roll back and look how to install it on my other devices. Also I wanted to find a way to build kernel with WiFi drivers.

Also I'm a Openwrt user. My current router is now 10 years old and I was looking for a new one. And apparently not all routers support openwrt - due to absence of FOSS sources. 

Also before buying new phone I was checking 4PDA on community support for a phone. My `Xiaomi kenzo` is 4 years old and was upgraded from android 5.1 to Android 10. My wife's `Xiaomi santoni` is 3 years old and has Treble support, so os should flow for a little while more. When I was choosing them I wasn't choosing specificly for a vendor but more for a price, but I'm happy that i've chosen the right one.

So finally idea is that there are good vendors (in relation to diy-guys and openness) and bad ones.

| Bad      | Good     |
|----------|----------|
| Broadcom | Qualcomm |
| MTK      | Qualcomm |
| Apple    | AOSP, Ubuntu Touch|
