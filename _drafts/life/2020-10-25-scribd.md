## The Crossing Guard:
Too Depressing.

## Undiplomatic Murder:
After 3 hours of non-stop action, the book turned into a shadow of itself - constantly recalling what happened before and reflecting on it.

## The Best Revenge
Awesome book. Great plot.

## Midnight in Madrid
It's female verison of 'Jack Reacher', with dressing and emotions and female protagonist. I realy enjoyed historical flashbacks. 4/5.
