I've a huge audiobooks fan - and i've been looking for audiobooks provider except Audible with a credits system. I've stumbled upon `Scribd` with a __listen how much you want for a month fee__ model.

Here are the books that I've experienced during free month trial:

## The Crossing Guard:
Too Depressing. I've skipped after 30 minutes.

## Undiplomatic Murder:
After 3 hours of non-stop action, the book turned into a shadow of itself - constantly recalling what happened before and reflecting on it.

## The Best Revenge
Awesome book. Great plot.

## Midnight in Madrid
It's female verison of 'Jack Reacher', with dressing and emotions and female protagonist. I realy enjoyed historical flashbacks. 4/5.

## Tricky business by Dave Barry (5 âœ¨)
It reminded me Doc Ford book 3. Casual and easy narration, and great insights into different professions.
Also parralel storytelling with rock band, croupier, old home people and shady business owner.
