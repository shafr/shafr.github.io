5 Hours in - great book. There were very few "Deus ex Machina" places.

Perfect example of Sci-fi detective  as it should be - without annoyances.

Great ammount of humor, not-a-superhero main character, cybernetics and technologies.

...

Last hour or 30 minutes was just a drag, the author was just preparing readers (or listeners) for the sequel. 

Still - highly recommending this book.
