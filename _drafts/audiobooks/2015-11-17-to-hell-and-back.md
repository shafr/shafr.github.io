One of the best historical audiobooks that I've listened to - lot's of things that were put in me by history teachers, stereotypes, propaganda were destroyed.

Lots of great quotes inside.

`Quote:` 
>> They dove not reflection of the world around them, but `escapism` and momentary excitement, temporary release of the drap ofter depressing reality of daily life. Going to the cinema offered a greatest chance of escapism. ... Cinemas provided what audiences wanted. Most films was comedies, dramas, adventure or romance. ... Professional sport, football especially offered another big escape for working man, though hardly at all for woman.
