One of the best historical audiobooks that I've listened to - lot's of things that were put in me by history teachers, stereotypes, propaganda were destroyed.

Lots of great quotes inside.

Those was sense of national unity with internal divisions temporarily overcome. For german intellectuals the new unity seems the embodiment of the spirit of 1914, almost the sense of religious awakening. It reinforced their feeling, that german culture wasn't simply different from, but was superior to French civilization with it's roots in revolution and republicanism, let alone the materialistic democracy in Britain.

>> The party's organization rigidly controlled from center by general secretary Joseph Stalin created system of patronage and corruption that bought to the elligions of growing numbers of place man and apparatchiks. The number of bureaucrats quadrupled to 2.4 million within 4 years of the revolution. And the huge influx of new party members - almost 1.5 million entered by 1920. 2/3 of them from peasant background hoping for better life's, helped the bolsheviks to consolidate their hold on power and to extend their penetration of countryside.

Early idealistic notions of popular participation in the running of political, economic and social masses through elective representatives in the soviets based upon worker control of production had on necessity been reformulated. Communism itself would have to wait till the dawn of utopia. Meanwhile power of the social state would and could be exercised by the avantgarde of proletarian - by party.

He was crucial in holding together a system that class and nationality interests in over 20 political parties threatened to undermine.
In december 1918 and the first days of 1919 Massyaryk used czech troops to suppress moves to establish independent republic in Slovakia. He called upon allied assistance and proclaimed a state of emergency as he deployed new army units, commanded by a french officers to repel the invasion to recover slovakia by pro-bolshevik forces in hungary in may and june 1919.
And he proved adapt at appointing a cabinet of officials independent of divisive party allegiances to tackle a wave of serious disturbances that summer.

All that was conventual or borjua was rejected. It was replaced by boundless esthetic experimentation with a new 'the modern`.
