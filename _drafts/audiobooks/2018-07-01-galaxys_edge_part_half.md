This one is kind of short story about robot who gave his life for humans. 
Hate this. The movies from 50th about cyborgs and dilemma if robots have souls.
But lots of action and details. 
Kind of `Hacksaw Ridge` but with killing robot instead of pacifist human.

Pros:
* Solid action
* Interesting storryteling

Cons:
* Very Short
